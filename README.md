Hi, my name is Irina! I am proud Bulgarian. To do mathematics is my genuine love!
I am interested in Python and Ruby, poetry and techno. I would like to put my talents into robotics, AI and Big Data, finding some great academic solutions among a great team!
Currently I am a student in Python Fundamentals Module at SoftUni (Bulgaria).
I am patient. Time brings with itself all we need.
