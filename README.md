Hi, my name is Irina. I am fascinated by space and time, words and numbers, metaphysics and robotics. Currently a Data Science Student in love with Jupyter Notebook! My native language is Bulgarian, went to Grund- and Realschule in Schleswig-Holstein, studied English in Oxford, exploring Latin and Japanese as a hobby.

In science, we always need a proof. Sarah Hart, Professor of Mathematics and the first woman Professor of Geometry at Gresham College London, ended her book "Once Upon a Prime: The Wondrous Connections Between Mathematics and Literature" with the sentence: "In literature, as in life, there are as many different ways to be a mathematician as there are different ways to be a person." This is my proof and the point where my interests meet.

The programming language I use is Scientific Python. Its libraries are working behind the scenes, therefore, the code is fast and compact.
