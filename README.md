Hi, my name is Irina! I am interested in Python and Ruby, ancient poetry and sophisticated techno. I would like to put my talents into Robotics and Data Science; finding some great academic solutions among a great team! Currently I am a student at Software University. I am patient. Time brings with itself all we need.
