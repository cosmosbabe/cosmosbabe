Hi, my name is Irina. I am fascinated by space and time, words and numbers, metaphysics and robotics. Currently a Data Science Student in love with Jupyter Notebook. My native language is Bulgarian, went to Grund- and Realschule in Germany, studied English in Oxford, exploring Latin and Japanese as a hobby.
